Distributed Computing Project (2): Pro Publica Collects Data on Facebook Ads

We are adressing the following questions: 
Question 1: How has the political advertising changed over time? Can you see differences in
the types of ads that have been used at different times? Do real-world events (e.g., the Christmas season, or the democratic primaries, etc) seem to affect what types of ads are shown? If so how?
Question 2: Not all political ads are the same. Can you group together similar ads? Are there multiple groups running similar ads (or ads that seem to focus on the same ideas/concepts)? Which categories of ads are most prevalent on Facebook? What issues seem most prevalent?
Question 3: Look at the words used in political advertisements. What words or phrases are most common in political ads? Are facebook ads trying to scare people? inspire people? persuade people? Can you say anything about general tone of an ad (positive/negative)
Question 4: Pro-Publica attempts to collect the targeting information from facebook ads. This is missing for many ads, but perhaps there is enough information in these fields to gain insight into ad targeting. Which groups are targeting their ads in which ways? Are certain types of ads targeted differently than others? Are there particular groups/segments of people who are targeted more than others in political advertising
